# NOMOS Standard

A universal standard for digital democracy — built on legal integrity (EU/CZ), human‑verified identity (Z‑identity), and censorship‑resistant infrastructure (Ghost Mesh). A governance framework for DAOs, communities, and real‑world institutions.

---

## Overview

NOMOS is a modular governance standard enabling secure, human‑verified, censorship‑resistant, and legally grounded decision‑making. It provides the foundations for democratic systems that cannot be captured by bots, infrastructure providers, or centralized authorities.

NOMOS is not a platform. It is a standard that any DAO, community, or institution can adopt, extend, or implement.

## Core Components

### Z‑identity
A privacy‑preserving identity layer based on zero‑knowledge proofs.

- one human = one identity  
- non‑transferable, bot‑resistant, and Sybil‑proof  
- privacy by default  
- compatible with legal KYC without exposing personal data  

Z‑identity ensures that governance remains human and legitimate.

### Ghost Mesh
A censorship‑resistant infrastructure layer running through users’ devices instead of centralized servers.

- no kill switch  
- no cloud dependency  
- peer‑to‑peer propagation of governance actions  
- resilient against censorship and shutdowns  

Ghost Mesh makes governance technically indestructible.

### Legal Layer
A governance framework grounded in EU/CZ law.

- enforceable governance outcomes  
- compatibility with real‑world institutions  
- long‑term legitimacy beyond crypto‑native environments  

Digital democracy must be lawful to be durable.

## Architecture

- **Identity Layer:** Z‑identity (ZK‑based, human‑verified, non‑transferable)  
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Ghost Mesh (P2P, device‑based, censorship‑resistant)  
- **Legal Layer:** EU/CZ governance framework  
- **Governance Layer:** proposals, voting, execution  
- **Integration Layer:** APIs and interfaces for DAOs and institutions

## Why NOMOS

Traditional token‑based governance leads to:

- plutocracy  
- vote buying  
- bot manipulation  
- lack of legal enforceability  
- centralized infrastructure risks  

NOMOS combines cryptographic, legal, and infrastructural guarantees to create governance that is democratic, resilient, and real.

## TIGR as First Adopter

TIGR will be the first system to implement the NOMOS standard, providing:

- real‑world testing  
- community‑driven refinement  
- proof of legitimacy and resilience  
- a reference implementation for others  

NOMOS is built for everyone — TIGR is the first to adopt it.

---

## Roadmap

- Z‑identity specification and reference implementation  
- Ghost Mesh prototype and device clients  
- Legal framework publication  
- Governance modules and integration layer  
- TIGR deployment and public standard release  

---

## Contributing

NOMOS is an open standard. Contributions are welcome in:

- cryptography  
- distributed systems  
- legal analysis  
- governance research  
- documentation  
- implementations
